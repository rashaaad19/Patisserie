### Learning Experience with React Router Dom
---
**This project was created as a learning exercise to gain experience with React Router. It should be noted that this is not a production-ready application but rather a sandbox environment for practicing and applying React Router features.**

Throughout the development process, I explored various aspects of React Router, including
* Creating Routers 
* Configuring routes and paths
* Using loader functions
* Adding error elements and handling different errors
* Using different react router hooks like useNavigate

This project provided an opportunity to apply and reinforce my understanding of React Router  concepts in a practical setting.
